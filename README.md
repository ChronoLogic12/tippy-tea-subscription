### Design

As tippy is targeted as a specialist and high end service I wanted the site to reflect this with a clean and clear design. I chose to use a fairly soft pallet in shades of green to tie in to the product and give a somewhat premium feel and included a dark raspberry accent/action colour to compliment.
